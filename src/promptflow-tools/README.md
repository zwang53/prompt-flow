## Introduction

Tools are the fundamental building blocks of a flow in Azure Machine Learning prompt flow. Each tool is a simple, executable unit with a specific function, allowing users to perform various tasks. By combining different tools, users can create a flow that accomplishes a wide range of goals. One of the key benefit of prompt flow tools is their seamless integration with third-party APIs and python open source packages. This not only improves the functionality of large language models but also makes the development process more efficient.

In this package, we provide a set of builtin tools of prompt flow, which are the most commonly used tools in the development of AI applications. We also provide a flexible way for users to create their own tools and share them with others. See [Custom tool package creation and usage](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-create-and-use-your-own-tool-package.md) for more details.
