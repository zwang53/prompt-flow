# Contributing to examples folder

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the examples folder. This folder contains a collection of Python notebooks and selected markdown files that demonstrate various usage of this promptflow project. The script will automatically generate a README.md file in the root folder, listing all the notebooks and markdown files with their corresponding workflows.

## Guidelines for notebooks and markdown files in examples folder

When creating or modifying a notebook or markdown file, please follow these guidelines:

- Each notebook or markdown file should have a clear and descriptive title as the first line
- Each notebook or markdown file should have a brief introduction that explains the purpose and scope of the example. For details, please refer to the readme workflow generator manual [README.md](../scripts/readme/README.md) file.
  - The first sentence of first paragraph of the markdown file is important. The introduction should be concise and informative, and end with a period.
  - Each notebook file should have a metadata area when the file is opened as a big JSON file. The metadata area may contain the following fields:
    - `.metadata.description`: (Mandatory) A short description of the example that will be displayed in the README.md file. The description should be concise and informative, and end with a period.
    - `.metadata.stage`: (Optional) A value that indicates whether the script should skip generating a workflow for this notebook or markdown file. If set to `development`, the script will ignore this file. If set to other values or omitted, the script will generate a workflow for this file.
- Each notebook or markdown file should have a clear and logical structure, using appropriate headings, subheadings, comments, and code cells. The code cells should be executable and produce meaningful outputs.
- Each notebook or markdown file should follow the [PEP 8] style guide for Python code, and use consistent and readable variable names, indentation, spacing, and punctuation.
- Each notebook or markdown file should include relevant references, citations, and acknowledgements

## Generate workflows, update README.md and submit pull requests

To run the readme.py script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the required packages by running:

```bash
# At this examples folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the script by:

```bash
# At the root of this repository
python scripts/readme/readme.py
```

For detailed usage of readme.py, please refer to the readme workflow generator manual [README.md](../scripts/readme/README.md) 

### Update [README.md](./README.md) in [examples](./) folder

The readme.py script will scan all the notebooks and markdown files in the examples folder, and generate a README.md file in the root folder. The README.md file will contain a table of contents with links to each notebook and markdown file, as well as their descriptions and workflows.

### Generations in the [workflows](../.github/workflows/) folder

This contains two parts:
* For notebooks, we'll prepare standard workflow running environment to test the notebook to the end.
* For markdowns, The workflows are generated by extracting the `bash` cells from markdown file. The workflows will prepare standard workflow running environment and test these cells to the end.

The script will also save workflows in the [workflows](../.github/workflows/) folder, where each notebook or markdown file will have a corresponding workflow file with the `.yml` extension. The workflow files can be triggered by creating a new pull request or pushing a new commit to the repository. The workflow will run the notebook or markdown file, and you could check the outputs afterwards.
