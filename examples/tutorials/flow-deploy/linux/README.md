# How to use exported dockerfile

## Exported Dockerfile Structure

Exported Dockerfile & its dependencies are located in the same folder. The structure is as below:
- flow: the folder contains all the flow files
  - ...
- connections: the folder contains yaml files to create all related connections
  - ...
- Dockerfile: the dockerfile to build the image
- start.sh: the script used in `CMD` of `Dockerfile` to start the service
- deploy.sh & deploy.ps1: the script to deploy the docker image to Azure App Service
- settings.json: a json file to store the settings of the docker image
- README.md: the readme file to describe how to use the dockerfile

## Build Docker image

Like other Dockerfile, you need to build the image first. You can tag the image with any name you want. In this example, we use `promptflow-serve`.

After cd to the output directory, run the command below:

```bash
docker build . -t promptflow-serve
```

## Run Docker image

Run the docker image will start a service to serve the flow inside the container. Service will listen on port 8080.
You can map the port to any port on the host machine as you want.

If the service involves connections, all related connections will be exported as yaml files and recreated in containers.

Secrets in connections won't be exported directly. Instead, we will export them as a reference to environment variables:

```yaml
configs:
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_BASE: xxx
  CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: xxx
module: promptflow.connections
name: custom_connection
secrets:
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${env:<connection-name>_<secret-key>}
type: custom
```

You'll need to set up the environment variables in the container to make the connections work.

### Deploy with Azure App Service

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.
Promptflow has provided a [script](./deploy.sh) to help deploy the docker image to Azure App Service.

Example command to use bash script:
```bash
bash deploy.sh -i <image_tag> -r "promptflow.azurecr.io" -g <resource_group>
```

Example command to use powershell script:
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 -i <image_tag> -r "promptflow.azurecr.io" -g <resource_group>
```

See the full parameters by `bash deploy.sh -h` or `.\deploy.ps1 -h`.

### Run with `docker run`

You can run the docker image directly set via below commands:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e <connection-name>_<secret-key>=<secret-value> promptflow-serve
```

As explain in previously, secrets in connections will be passed to container via environment variables.
You can set up multiple environment variables for multiple connection secrets:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e <connection-name-1>_<secret-key>=<secret-value-1> -e <connection-name-2>_<secret-key>=<secret-value-2> promptflow-serve
```

## Test the endpoint
After start the service, you can use curl to test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/score --data '{"text":"Hello world!"}' -X POST  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
